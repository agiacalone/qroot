Due Feb 26

Write a FORTRAN program that solves quadratic equations for both real and complex roots. Use the quadratic formula, 
of course. The key thing here is FORTRAN. Submit a hardcopy of the code.

Sample output below.

This program calculates the real or complex (imaginary) roots of a quadratic equation.
Enter Values for A, B and C:5 6 1
Equation has two real roots.
Root1 = -0.200000   Root2 = -1.000000

Do another? (y)y

Enter Values for A, B and C:1 0 9
Equation has two imaginary roots.
Root1 = 3.000000*i   Root2 = -3.000000*i

Do another? (y)y

Enter Values for A, B and C:1 6 9
Equation has one real root.
Root1 = -3.000000

Do another? (y)y

Enter Values for A, B and C:1 0 -9
Equation has two real roots.
Root1 = 3.000000   Root2 = -3.000000

Do another? (y)n
